## Guide

This repository contains a collection of C files, each with a specific function designed to perform various tasks. The code within these files is written in C programming language and is part of the ALX low-level programming curriculum. The following is an overview of each file and its respective function:

1. **0-puts_recursion.c**
   - This file contains a function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.

2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c**
   - Inside this file, you'll find a function that prints a string in reverse order using recursion.

3. **2-strlen_recursion.c**
   - The file hosts a function that returns the length (number of characters) of a given string using recursion.

4. **3-factorial.c**
   - Here, you can find a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

5. **4-pow_recursion.c**
   - This file contains a function that calculates and returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c**
   - Inside this file, there is a function that calculates and returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

7. **6-is_prime_number.c**
   - Here, you'll find a function that determines whether an input integer is a prime number. It returns 1 if the number is prime and 0 if it is not, utilizing recursion.

8. **100-is_palindrome.c**
   - This file contains a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). It returns 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not.

9. **101-wildcmp.c**
   - Inside this file, there is a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, considering the presence of wildcards. It returns 0 if the strings are not identical.

10. **_putchar.c**
    - This file contains the `_putchar` function, which is used for character output.

11. **main.h**
    - `main.h` is the header file that includes function prototypes for all the functions defined in the other files. It serves as a reference for using these functions in other parts of your code.
