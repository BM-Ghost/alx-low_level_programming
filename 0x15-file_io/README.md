# File I/O in C

File I/O (Input/Output) in the C programming language is a fundamental concept that enables the reading and writing of data to and from files stored on a computer's storage. This feature provides a versatile means to interact with files, allowing developers to perform various tasks such as reading configuration files, logging data, and processing external data sources within C programs.

## Key Features

- **Reading from Files:** C supports reading data from files, making it possible to access and utilize external data sources.

- **Writing to Files:** Data can be written to files, allowing for data storage and logging of information.

- **File Handling:** Developers can open, close, and manipulate files, ensuring proper control over file resources.

## Usage

To use file I/O in C, developers can employ functions from the standard C library such as `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, and `fwrite` to open, close, read, and write files.
