# Project 0x07 - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

This project comprises several C files, each implementing different functions. Here's an overview of each file's purpose:
1. **0-memset.c:** This file contains a function that fills a block of memory with a specified constant byte.

2. **1-memcpy.c:** Within this file, you'll find a function that copies a specified number of bytes from one memory area to another.

3. **2-strchr.c:** This file houses a function that searches for a specific character within a given string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that character.

4. **3-strspn.c:** Here, you'll find a function that calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists of only characters from a specified set.

5. **4-strpbrk.c:** This file contains a function that searches a string for any character from a specified set and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of any such character.

6. **5-strstr.c:** Within this file, there's a function that searches for a substring within a given string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the substring.

7. **7-print_chessboard.c:** This file contains a function that prints a chessboard, represented as a two-dimensional array of characters.

8. **8-print_diagsums.c:** Here, you'll find a function that calculates and prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

9. **100-set_string.c:** This file holds a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

Additionally, there is a header file named **main.h** that includes the prototypes for these functions, and the file **_putchar.c** contains the implementation of the `_putchar` function.

For advanced task 9:
1. Open the file using `vi -b 101-crackme_password`.
2. Once the vi window is open, avoid using insert mode and type `:set binary` followed by Enter.
3. Type `:set noeol` and hit Enter.
4. Enter insert mode (press 'i') and type the password, for example, "abc123."
5. Exit insert mode (press 'Esc') and save the file by typing `:wq` and hitting Enter.
